## What is this?

Google reader is shutting down.  A lot of people use it.  A lot of apps depend on its API.
This project will be an attempt to create an API compatible replacement so those apps will 
continue to work by simply changing the API end point.  I have no plans to build a frontend UI 
replacement, just the backend API.  Once we have the Google Reader API working, we may be able
to add extensions to it so that apps can add additional features that weren't previously possible.

## Tech

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org) (so I can try something new!)
* [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
* [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/)

Some interesting modules to investigate:

* https://github.com/danmactough/node-feedparser
* https://github.com/dylang/node-rss

Some unofficial API documentation on the old Google Reader API that we'd be copying
